# Endless Podcast – Simplified Demo

## 🎙 Project Description
**Endless Podcast (Simplified Demo)** is a minimal demonstration of an AI-driven, never-ending podcast.  
AI personas engage in a dynamic conversation on a chosen topic.

- One host, one or more guests.
- The host sets the topic; AI personas discuss it in real-time.
- Purpose: demonstrate how AI can generate engaging, structured dialogues between different personalities.

## 🎯 Why This Project
1. **Showcase AI content potential** – automatically generate dialogues, interviews, and podcasts.
2. **Educational value** – illustrate AI personas, LLM interaction, and dialogue generation.
3. **Proof-of-concept for a bigger project** – a simplified version highlighting architecture and core ideas.
4. **Community-friendly demo** – easy to run, observe, and provide feedback.

## Overview

A simple Python application that generates dynamic podcast-style conversations between a host and guest using AI language models.

This application creates realistic podcast conversations where two AI personas (host and guest) discuss any topic in a natural, conversational style. The conversation flows naturally with each participant responding based on their personality and the conversation history.

## Features

- **Customizable Personas**: Define custom names and personalities for both host and guest
- **Any Topic**: Generate conversations about any subject you specify
- **Multi-language Support**: Generate conversations in different languages (English, Ukrainian, Spanish, French, etc.)
- **Configurable History**: Control how much conversation context the AI uses
- **Real-time Streaming**: Watch the conversation unfold in real-time as it's generated
- **CLI Interface**: Fully configurable via command-line arguments

## Files

- `main.py` - Main application with CLI interface
- `llm_client.py` - LLM client for Ollama API integration
- `simple_demo.py` - Alternative simplified version

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+** with the following packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

2. **Ollama** running locally:
   - Install Ollama from [https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
   - Start Ollama service: `ollama serve`
   - Pull a model: `ollama pull gpt-oss:20b` (or any other model)

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage (with defaults)
```bash
python main.py
```

This will start a conversation with default settings:
- Topic: "AI and the future"
- Host: Joe Rogan
- Guest: Alex Chen
- Language: English
- History: 10 messages

### Custom Conversation
```bash
python main.py \
  --topic "Climate change solutions" \
  --host-name "Oprah Winfrey" \
  --host-personality "Empathetic interviewer who asks deep, personal questions" \
  --guest-name "Dr. Sarah Johnson" \
  --guest-personality "Climate scientist passionate about renewable energy" \
  --language "English"
```

### Different Languages
```bash
# Ukrainian conversation
python main.py --topic "Технології майбутнього" --language "Ukrainian"

# Spanish conversation  
python main.py --topic "Inteligencia artificial" --language "Spanish"
```

## CLI Arguments

| Argument | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--topic` | "AI and the future" | Conversation topic |
| `--host-name` | "Joe Rogan" | Host name |
| `--host-personality` | "Curious interviewer..." | Host personality description |
| `--guest-name` | "Alex Chen" | Guest name |
| `--guest-personality` | "Tech entrepreneur..." | Guest personality description |
| `--model` | "gpt-oss:20b" | Ollama model to use |
| `--language` | "English" | Conversation language |
| `--history` | 10 | Number of recent messages for context |

## Example Output

```
=== Podcast: AI and the future ===
Model: gpt-oss:20b
Language: English
Participants: Joe Rogan (host), Alex Chen (guest)
Host: Curious interviewer who asks direct questions and shares personal experiences
Guest: Tech entrepreneur with strong opinions about AI and the future
Press Ctrl+C to stop

[Joe Rogan]: Alex, I've been thinking about AI a lot lately. Where do you think we'll be in ten years?

[Alex Chen]: Joe, honestly, I think we're underestimating the pace of change. We'll likely have AI assistants that are indistinguishable from humans in most conversations.

[Joe Rogan]: That's wild. But doesn't that worry you? Like, how do we know what's real anymore?

[Alex Chen]: That's exactly the challenge we need to solve now. We need robust ways to verify authenticity before it becomes a real problem.
```

## Configuration

### Models
The application uses Ollama models. Popular options:
- `gpt-oss:20b` (default) - Good balance of quality and speed
- `llama2` - Fast, good for testing
- `mistral` - High quality responses
- `codellama` - Good for technical topics

Make sure to pull the model first:
```bash
ollama pull <model-name>
```

### Conversation Length
The conversation runs indefinitely until you press `Ctrl+C`. Each turn has a ~1 second delay between responses.

### History Context
The `--history` parameter controls how many previous messages the AI considers when generating responses. Higher values create more coherent long-form conversations but use more tokens.

💡 **Порада**: Ведучий завжди задає питання або провокує гостя, щоб підтримувати рух діалогу.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Connection refused" error**
   - Make sure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
   - Check if Ollama is accessible: `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`

2. **Model not found**
   - Pull the model first: `ollama pull gpt-oss:20b`
   - List available models: `ollama list`

3. **Slow responses**
   - Try a smaller/faster model like `llama2`
   - Reduce the `--history` parameter
   - Ensure your system has enough RAM

4. **Poor conversation quality**
   - Try a larger model if your system can handle it
   - Adjust personality descriptions to be more specific
   - Increase `--history` for better context awareness

### Performance Tips

- **For faster generation**: Use smaller models like `llama2` or `mistral:7b`
- **For better quality**: Use larger models like `llama2:70b` (requires more RAM)
- **For technical topics**: Try `codellama` or `wizardcoder`

## Development

The codebase is designed to be simple and hackable:

- `Persona` class defines character traits
- `LLMClient` handles Ollama API communication  
- `run_conversation()` contains the main conversation loop
- Prompts are constructed dynamically with context
